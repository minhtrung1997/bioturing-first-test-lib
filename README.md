# bioturing-first-test-lib (Trung-bftl)

A python library for my first test in BioTuring company 29/8/2024

- Requirement: To get an overview of bioinformatics and assess your skills, please complete 40 problems within the "Bioinformatics Stronghold" section in Rosalind platform link: [Link to Rosalind: https://rosalind.info/problems/locations/].

- To finish this, I decide to build a library repo, each item function in a library solve a problem in Rosalind.
- There are about 40 problems in Rosalind, ordered in `list_topic_order_1-40.tsv` file.
- Problems are solved in a Jupyter notebook, `test-notebook-problem1_40.ipynb`
- The jupyter notebook import functions from `trung_bftl/problem_functions.py`.
- The test files input are placed in `test-files` folder.
